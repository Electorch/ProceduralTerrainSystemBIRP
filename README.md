# ProceduralTerrainSystemBIRP
This package is based on the work of Sebastian Lague. It follows his procedural landmass generation series but without all the overcomplicated stuff. How to spawn objects and path on terrain!


You have to unzip Electurch.zip inside Assets\ElectorchStrauss\ProceduralTerrainSystem\Art\Meshes
I couldn't upload it to git without compressing it.
